# news-search

Work in Progress. Allows visitors to the site to search numerous news sites using the News API provided by https://newsapi.org/. 
To see this project run simply download it to a folder on your localhost and generate an API key from https://newsapi.org/. The API Key can then be inserted into the config file found in config/index.php and also edit the domain variable in this file so that it reflects your folder structure e.g. http://localhost/news/

- user registration

- customizing homepage news
